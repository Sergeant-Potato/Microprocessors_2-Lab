## About the Project
### Introduction
This repository contains all the assignments and example execises of my university's **Microporcessors II Laboratory** course. This course was also known as **Laboratory of Micro-Computer Intefacing**. The files whose names start with zeros (0's) are examples; the other ones are the solutions that were developed for each of the assignments. 

In addition, it should be noted that the code that was developed throughout this course was in **C** using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) for the **Arduino Mega ADK**.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
In order to use the files found in this repository, the following is needed:
-  Arduino Mega ADK
-  Arduino IDE
-  Depending on the program, possibly, pin wires, resistors, breadboards and Arduino compatible hardware, like LCDs and Step Motors.

### Installation
Firstly, depending one the Arduino Program to be compiled, all required hardware components like pin cables and resistors must be already connected properly on the used breadboard. After this has been done, open the associated program in the the Arduino IDE and connect the Arduino Mega ADK to the computer via a USB cable.

## Usage
To see the various programs in action, compile and run them with the Arduino IDE while the computer is connected to the Arduino Mega ADK.

## Important Notes
- Remember, Remember AND Remember to check wether all cables, resistors and other components used for each of the given Arduino programs haven already been connected properly! Also, check if all of the pins that are used are the correct ones! **IF SOMETHING IS NOT CONNECTED PROPERLY, IT CAN DESTROY YOUR ARDUINO! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! PLAY WITH THE FILES OF THIS REPOSITORY AT YOUR OWN RISK!**
- If you do not know how to properly connect and handle your Arduino for each of the programs to work, go to [Arduino - Home](https://www.arduino.cc/) and find information on the various Arduino Hardware Schematics and Pinoits!
- This repository includes the laboratory reports that were developed for each of the Arduino programs. These files contain some information on the hardware components that were used, as well as on how they were connected.
